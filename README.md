# solana-geyser-plugin
A gRPC Geyser plugin for Solana is a Geyser plugin that streams real-time on-chain data (such as account updates, transactions, and block events) from the Solana validator over a generic, language-agnostic gRPC interface.

Key points:

1. The plugin connects to the Solana validator and listens for events using the Geyser plugin API.

2. Instead of directly writing data to a database or message queue, it exposes a gRPC server that clients can connect to.

3. Any client (written in any language that supports gRPC) can subscribe to this plugin, receive updates, and process or route them to their desired backend (Postgres, Kafka, analytics pipelines, etc.).

4. Makes integration flexible and decoupled: you only need to implement the receiver logic for your backend, while the plugin provides a unified stream.
